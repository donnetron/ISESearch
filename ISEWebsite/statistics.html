				<h2 class="blog-post-title">Most notices by company</h2>
				<div class="chart"><canvas id="totalCompaniesChart"></canvas></div>
				<p id="totalCompaniesChartDesc">This pie chart shows the top 15 companies, with the most notices published on the Irish Stock Exchange.</p>
				<p>The largest by far is the Irish Stock Exchange itself, which publishes all notices related to new listings and other information that applies to the exchange or all listings generally.</p>
				<p>After the Irish Stock Exchange, the next most prolific publishers of RIS notices are large corporates. A securitisation vehicle will not typically publish notices nearly as frequently, however where the securitised asset is a business or includes loans for large managed properties (e.g. a WBS or CMBS) there is a likelihood of more notices being published in times of stress where the price of the bonds may be affected due to actions taken with respect to the underlying assets.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post-title">Yearly growth</h2>
				<div class="chart"><canvas id="yearChart"></canvas></div>
				<p id="yearChartDesc">This chart shows the total number of notices published per year. Since the data became available in 2003, the number has grown year on year up to 2008, following a strong decline which might be as a result of a reduced number of listings during and following the financial crisis.</p>
				<p>The line chart that is overlaid shows the total number of notices published up to (but excluding) the current month of the year.</p>
				<!-- http://SOLR_URL.com//select?q=*:*&facet=true&facet.date=datetime&facet.date.start=2003-01-01T00:00:00.100Z&facet.date.end=NOW/YEAR%2B1YEAR&facet.date.gap=%2B1YEAR&rows=0&wt=json -->

				<h2 class="blog-post-title">Daytime busyness</h2>
				<div class="chart"><canvas id="hourChart"></canvas></div>
				<p>This chart shows the average number of notices publishes per hour. That is, a total number of <span class="totalNotices highlight bold">.totalNotices</span> notices have been published since 1 January 2003 (being <span class="totalNoticeDays highlight bold">.totalNoticeDays</span> days on which the exchange was open for business). This results in an average of <span class="averageNoticesPerDay highlight bold">.averageNoticesPerDay</span> being published on a business day.</p>

				<p id="hourChartDesc">The early 7am spike is probably accounted for by a backlog of notices that were submitted for publication close to, or after the close of business the day before. Day spikes might be as a result of batch publication, or otherwise just as an indication of people's productivity; there seems to be a natural lull over lunchtime!</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post-title">Weekly trends</h2>
				<div class="chart"><canvas id="dayChart"></canvas></div>
				<p id="dayChartDesc">This radar chart shows the average number of notices published per day. The spread is relatively even apart from a slight dip on Monday. This is probably due to the fact that Ireland has 5 bank holidays per year which fall on a Monday which the chart doesn't take account of.</p>

				<p id="hallOfShameDesc">The above companies were the last three who didn't proof read their RIS notices! Notices published by a company with listed securities were published due to a requirement under the EU Market Abuse Directive, and related legislation concerning definitions of what constitutes inside information and market manipulation.</p>
				<p>At some point in 2006, a notice was published (based on a form document, scheduled to a securitisation servicing agreement), that referred to <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:028:0043:0044:en:PDF">Commission Directive 2003/12/EC</a>, rather than <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:339:0070:0072:EN:PDF">Commission Directive 2003/12<strong>4</strong>/EC</a>. The small typo has resulted in a slew of <span id="totalEU12Notices" class="highlight bold">#totalEU12Notices</span> further notices published by companies (or their advisers) recycling old documents, which has continued for a decade. Of course, following the implementation of the Market Abuse Regulation (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0596&from=EN">Regulation (EU) No 596/2014</a>) which took effect on all Member States from 3 July 2016 (and which repealed the aforementioned Directive 2003/124) all RIS notices disclosing inside information should instead refer to this legislation instead.<p/>
